pydirduplicatefinder (0.3.0) beta; urgency=low

  * The runnable script name has been changed to duplicatefinder.py.
  * You can now pass multiple target directories as parameters.
  * Added a --action=ask option for choosing at every duplicate what action
    perform (interactive mode).
  * Added the --include-dir option for limit the search only to specific
    directories.
  * Added the --exclude-dir option for skipping the search from some
    directories.
  * Added the --include-file option for match only some files in the
    search.
  * Added the --exclude-file option for skipping files from the search,
    based on file name.
  * Using a wrong directory name was not handled, but was producing only
    abnormal termination.
  * More kindly handle of the break (CTRL+C) user's action.
  * Added the --verbose option to print some more message infos.
  * Added the --quiet option to output nothing at all.
  * Removed the _same_file function. Python already have a filecmp module
    (hoping this is faster)!
  * Added environment for automated tests, and tests too (use the
    --action=tests).
  * Some fixes to the command line help.
